\renewcommand{\sectiontitle}{ASCII}
\section{\sectiontitle}
% There were other text encoding standards before ASCII, but ASCII is one that is still used
% sometimes.
% Today, the international standard character set is Unicode, and the standard character encodings
% are the Unicode Transformation Formats.
%
% We'll examine the ASCII standard and its limitations, and then look at how Unicode and UTF
% attempt to ameliorate these issues.

\renewcommand{\currenttitle}{Character set vs.\ character encoding}
\begin{frame}{\currenttitle}
% Before we can talk specifically about ASCII or Unicode, we need to define some terms.
% Historically, many of these terms were generally synonymous, but have since become related
% but distinct terms.
%
% A character set denotes a collection of characters that are used in a written language.
% Think of the English alphabet. The upper and lowercase letters A to Z, puntuation symbols,
% and numerical digits would constitute the character set of basic English.
%
% Now, the coded character set is indicates how each character in the character set should be
% mapped to code points.
% Code points are, in our case, numerical values.
%
% So, each character in the character set is mapped to a a numerical value.
% For example, as we'll see in ASCII, the uppercase A is mapped to the code point value of 65.
%
% Finally, the character encoding indiciates how we map those code points, those numerical
% values, into bytes that we can write to memory or storage.
% Naturally, an encoding also specifies how we'll decode the data back into code points and
% characters.

\renewcommand{\currenttitle}{1963 \textendash{} ASCII}
\begin{frame}{\currenttitle}
% The text encoding standard ASCII was first published in 1963. It was based on telegraph code.
% Designed for use of English, it encodes 0 - 9, a - z, A - Z, and punctuation symbols like
% the period and parenthesis. It also has characters such as the line feed and carriage return.
%
% So when we store text according to the ASCII encoding, we convert each character into its
% corresponding numerical value, and then store that value in binary.

% See here a table of all the characters in the ASCII character set.
% This is first page.
%
% In the first column, we see the code point value (in decimal) assigned to each character.
% In the second column, we see the hex equivalent.
% If you remember from two slides ago, this is called the coded character set.
%
% The lowest values are some non-printable characters.
%
% Notice especially the NUL character, which was assigned the value of zero.
% The NUL character is pretty important in a a variety of different domains, such as printing.
% In the C programming language and some data formats, the NUL character indicates the
% termination of a string.
%
% Notice the numerical characters 0 to 9 are assigned values from 48 to 57.

\renewcommand{\currenttitle}{7-bit ASCII encoding}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\currenttitle}
% There are 16 rows, and 8 column groups. That means there are 128 characters to be encoded.
% The maximum value assigned is 127.
%
% 128 = 2^7.
% That means any character in the ASCII character set can be stored in a minimum of 7 bits.
% Any of these character can be stored in less than a single byte.
%
% This is where we get to the character encoding part.
%
% The ASCII standard initially specified a 7-bit encoding to reduce costs in transmitting
% data.
% Below we can see that encoding the word "Hi" takes up 14 bits.
%
% If we refer back to our chart above, we see that the letter H is mapped to the code point 72,
% or, in hex, 48.
% In binary, that's 1001000.
%
% The lowercase i is mapped to the codepoint 105, or 69 in hex.
% In binary, that's 1101001.
%
% The 7-bit ASCII encoding simply stores these translated code points in order.
% In all, "Hi" takes up 14 bits, the first 7 dedicated to H, and the remaining for i.
%
% Like endianness, bits can be ordered starting from least significant bit or most significant
% bit.
% But in modern computers, where the octet or byte is the basic unit of memory indexing,
% we're not really gonna worry about that.
% In the figure below, we've shown it starting from the most significant bit.

\renewcommand{\currenttitle}{8-bit ASCII encoding}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\currenttitle}
% As 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit computers became more widespread, 8-bit encoding derivatives
% developed. These use all 8-bits of a byte instead of 7.
%
% For some 8-bit derivatives, since only 7 bits are needed to store the character, the
% 8th bit is used as a parity bit for error checking. Others set it to 0.
%
% The 8-bit encoding for "Hi" therefore takes up a 16 bits, or 2 bytes.
% The first 7 bits are dedicated to H, then a parity or empty bit.
% Bits 9 to 15 are for i, and the 16th bit is another parity bit.
%
% Because ASCII-encoded characters only take up a single byte at most, we don't need to
% worry about endianness.
% The first byte will be the first character; the second byte will be the second character.
% Remember, endianness is only relevant to multi-byte data.

\renewcommand{\currenttitle}{Writing an ASCII decoder}
\begin{frame}{\currenttitle}
% Let's actually write an ASCII decoder for the 8-bit encoding.
% This should be pretty trivial.
%
% Our input will be a vector of unsigned 8-bit integers representing the bytes of memory
% we're reading.
% We'll output a string with the decoded characters.
%
% We simply convert each byte value, or the code point, to its corresponding ASCII character,
% then concatenate the resulting characters into a string.

\newcommand{\nonasciiitem}[2][???]{\item[] #2 \textrightarrow{} #1}
\begin{frame}{\currenttitle}
% As you can probably guess, there are some pretty obvious caveats to ASCII.
%
% Because the encoding stores one character in one byte, we can't store much else.
% If we make full use of all 8 bits, we can store another 128 characters, pushing our total
% of supported characters up to 256.
%
% But there are obviously more than 256 characters in the world.
% What if we want to write an e with an acute accent to write words like résumé, or write
% French?
% What about Chinese characters or Japanese kanji? How do we encode and store that?

% These we call true extended ASCII, because they preserve the original ASCII character set.
% There are also non-true extended ASCII character sets.

% sign.
%
% With these, we can cover more characters, but they're not very robust solutions.
% And we'll see that there are other issues with simple encodings like these.
