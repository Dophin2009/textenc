% There were other text encodings before ASCII, but ASCII is one that is still used sometimes.
% Today, the international standard of text encoding is Unicode.
%
% We'll examine the ASCII standard and its limitations, and then look at how Unicode attempts
% to ameliorate these issues.

\renewcommand{\currenttitle}{1963 \textendash{} ASCII}
\begin{frame}{\currenttitle}
% The text encoding standard ASCII was first published in 1963. It was based on telegraph code.
% Designed for use of English, it encodes 0 - 9, a - z, A - Z, and punctuation symbols like
% the period and parenthesis. It also has characters such as the line feed and carriage return.
%
% The designers of ASCII, like with text encodings that came before it, assigned each character
% a number.
% So when we store text according to the ASCII encoding, we convert each character into its
% corresponding numerical value, and then store that value in binary.

% See here a table of all the characters encoded in the ASCII standard. This is first page.
%
% In the first column, we see the decimal value assigned to each character.
% In the second column, we see the hex equivalent.
%
% The lowest values are some non-printable characters.
%
% Notice especially the NUL character, which was assigned the value of zero.
% The NUL character is pretty important in a a variety of different domains, such as printing.
% In the C programming language and some data formats, the NUL character indicates the
% termination of a string.
%
% Notice the numerical characters 0 to 9 are assigned values from 48 to 57.

% These are the rest of the characters specified by the ASCII standard.

% Notice that the alphabeta starts on 65 with uppercase characters.
% Then there are a few symbols, and then the lowercase characters from 97 to 122.

% There are 16 rows, and 8 column groups. That means there are 128 characters encoded.
% The maximum value assigned is 127.
%
% 128 = 2^7.
% That means any ASCII-encoded character can be stored in 7 bits.
% Any ASCII-encoded character can be stored in a single byte.
%
% The ASCII standard initially specified a 7-bit encoding to reduce costs in transmitting
% data.
% As 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit computers became more widespread, 8-bit encoding derivatives
% developed. These use all 8-bits of a byte instead of 7.
%
% For some 8-bit derivatives, since only 7 bits are needed to store the character, the
% 8th bit was used as a parity bit for error checking. Others set it to 0.
