% I hope you were able to learn something, if not everything we talked about.
% If nothing else, I hope you were able to grasp these takeaways.
%
% As our discussion of Unicode has shown: text is complicated.
% The writing systems that are derived from our natural language are varied and complicated,
% so the way we handle these scripts is also complicated.
%
% And those complications make text processing non-trivial.
% These last couple of slides especially have shown that many operations we like to think
% are rather simple can turn out to be very complicated.
%
% It can be easy to look at everything and just throw up your hands and resign: it's too
% difficult.
% But as more and more people are connected by digital systems across the world, it's only
% become more important that our code is compatible with writing systems from across the
% world.
%
% Modern programs should all strive to be Unicode compatible.
% The moment you start taking user input, Unicode becomes relevant.
%
% And it's not something that has to be incredibly difficult.
% Unicode-aware libraries are widely available, and most modern languages incorporate tons
% of functionality in their standard libraries.
% We just need to be aware of these functionalities.
%
% I encourage everyone to explore the topic of text encoding in further detail.
% We've really only scratched surface of Unicode's specifications.
%
% If nothing else, I urge you to try to get some kind of understanding of how Unicode is
% supported in your programming language.
  \takeaway{Text is complicated}{
    Because natural language is complicated, the systems we develop to handle it are also
    complicated.
  }
  
  \takeaway{Text processing is non-trivial}{
    Operations that may seem simple are often far more complex.
  }
  
  \takeaway{Unicode matters}{
    All modern programs should support text input in any language\textemdash{}all
    modern programs should support Unicode.
