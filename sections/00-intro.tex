% What could be so hard about text, right?
% It's just a string of characters.
%
% In this talk, I'll be discussing how text is stored in computer memory.
% In the first part, I'll review computer memory concepts that you may or may not be totally
% familiar with.
% Then, we'll be discussing two encoding standards, ASCII and Unicode, the latter of which
% we'll only really scratch the surface of.
%
% By the end, I think you'll agree that text isn't so simple, but also not impossible to
% understand.
