% Computers store information bits, a portmanteau of "binary digit", which represent an "on"
% and an "off" state in the abstract sense.
%
% In the physical device, this might be two stable states of a flip-flop, two positions of an
% electrical switch, two distinct voltage or current levels allowed by a circuit, two distinct
% levels of light intensity.
  Computers store information in \textbf{bits} (0 or 1 / \texttt{TRUE} or \texttt{FALSE})

% Anyway, that's not really relevant to us at the moment.
% As you probably know, a byte is equal to 8 bits.
% This means there are 2^8 possible values contained in a single byte of data.
%
% In modern computers, memory is indexed by bytes. So while the bit is the smallest unit,
% you're typically going to be concerned mostly with bytes.
%
% We can, and we will, use hexadecimal instead of binary. If you don't remember, hexadecimal
% is base 16. The digits are 0 - 9, and then A - F representing 10 - 15. Since a byte is 8
% binary digits, we can easily convert it into 2 hex digits by splitting it into 2 groups of
% 4 binary digits and converting to hex.
  A \textbf{byte} is equal to 8 bits \\

  This means possible values are in the interval [$0_{10}$, $255_{10}$] \\

% Think of some data types that you've used in your code.
% This table has some of the sizes of Java primitives.
%
% An int in Java is a 32-bit integer, so it can store values from -2^31 to 2^31 - 1.
% Because Java doesn't distinguish between unsigned and signed number values like C, Rust,
% or other langauges do, the first bit is dedicated to indicating the sign.
%
% I'm not really going to get into how floating-point number types like float or double.
%
% Booleans, which are just a true/false value, should theoretically take up a single bit,
% but note that JVM stores booleans to take up a byte. That's because memory is usually
% indexed by bytes, increasing speed at the cost of a little bit of storage overhead.
  \begin{table}
    \begin{tabular}{c c c c}

      boolean & true / false flag & 1 & 1\footnotemark{} \\
      char & 16-bit character & 16 & 2 \\

% A type like Java's short, which is 32-bits, is going to take up 4 bytes of memory space.
% Because of historical reasons, this can pose problems.
%
% Let's say you have the decimal integer 168496141. In binary, this is a long value.
% We'll instead refer to it by its hexadecimal form: 0A0B0C0D. The largest byte is 0A,
% then 0B, then 0C, and the smallest byte is 0D.
%
% We call 0A the most significant byte. It has the most significant value.
% 0D is called the least significant byte.

% the least significant byte to the most significant byte.
% That means it reads 0D, then 0C, then 0B, then 0A.

% There are other architectures, like ARM64, which is growing in popularity, that are
% bi-endian.

% If you're curious about the etymology of 'endian', it comes from the 1762 satirical novel
% Gulliver's Travels, by Jonathan Swift.
% In one of Gulliver's journeys, he encounters a land of beings named Lilliputians.
% The Lilliputians have divided into two sects, one that holds the belief that the shell of
% a boiled egg should be broken from the big end, and the other from the little end.
% They're called big-endian and little-endian, and computer scientists took those terms.
% Lilliputian has also made it into the English dictionary and has the meaning tiny or trivial.

\begin{frame}{\currenttitle}
% So we've talked a little bit about how something like an integer is stored in memory.
% But what about text?
% Everything is stored in 0's and 1's, so to store text, we'll need to basically convert text
% into numbers or sequences of numbers.
%
% The conversion process is called text encoding.
%
% Now that we've got the necessary background to talk about text encoding, we'll start looking
% at two text encoding standards, ASCII and Unicode.
